# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the ROSEdu website. It's people like you that make the ROSEdu website such a great community.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

The purpose of this repository is the development and maintenance of the ROSEdu presentation website. As an non-governmental organization, the website expresses who we are, what our values are and who supports and stands beside us to help implement our vision of an open source, community-based education.

Use this repository to point out any issue with the website (content or otherwise). Feature requests (or pull requests) are very welcome!

# The TL;DR

 * We use [git flow](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) to help organize our work and to make sense of pull requests and contributions.
 * All tests are written using [Jest.](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
 * PR's should have tests written for any new components.
 * The current framework is based on [Gatsby.](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
 * All code *must* conform to the [standardjs](https://standardjs.com) styling rules. A setup using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is set to run on every commit on all `*.js` files to lint them to the mentioned style guide. 

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the ROSEdu website ? A good point to start is looking for typos or content that could be better presented. These are easy fixes that provide a good way to contribute.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
 
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first ðŸ˜Š

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
